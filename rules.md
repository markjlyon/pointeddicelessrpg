Challenges compare the two opponents totals:

- If the difference is 25% or more, that opponent wins in 1 action.
> P1 has 10, P2 has 15, P2 automatically wins the turn against P1.
- If the difference is less than 25%, you must spend additional turns focusing on that opponent until a number of turns equal to the difference have passed, only then is the winner revealed.
