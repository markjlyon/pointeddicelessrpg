# Lifeforms & Traits

All Lifeforms, and therefor all characters, have a base of 4 HP.

Choose your Lifeform concept (such as Human) then choose any four traits that fit your Lifeform concept from the below list below:

- +1 to a single Attribute
- +2 to a single Aspect
- +2 HP
- +2 Action Points
- Extra limbs (arms, legs, wings, a tail. etc.)
- Enhanced sense (night vision, telescopic vision, selective hearing, scent tracking, etc.)
- New sense (hear radio signals, sense living creatures, sense emotional auras, etc.)
- Natural weapon (Close Melee: claws, bite, wing buffet, tail swipe, etc.)
- Natural armor (Adds 1 Armor and causes the skin of the Lifeform to be thicker and less sensitive to touch)
- Environment Resistance (extremely cold, extremely dry, extremely hot, extremely humid, extreme altitudes, etc.)
- Waterbreathing
- Immunity to a Poison type (contact, ingested, venom, radiation, etc.)

Some Lifeform traits will not fit some concepts, such as Human with Extra Limbs or Waterbreathing, so should be avoided if it doesn't make sense in the campaign.

# Aptitudes

Inspiration - Once per combat you may spend an Action to inspire your party so each character, including yourself, will recover 1 Action Point.

# Action Points

Every character starts with 10 Action Points.

Action Points may be spent when a character attempts an action and increases their total by the number of Action Points spent.

A character recovers 1 Action Point per hour of continuous uninterrupted rest (sleep, power recharging, meditation, etc.).

A character that gets 1/3 of a day (8 hours for Earth) of continuous uninterrupted sleep recovers all Action Points.

# Weapons

There are three different types of weapons and one damaging ability in game: Light Melee, Heavy Melee, Ranged, and the ability of Magic.

| Type | Allowable Ranges | Damage | Notes |
|-|-|-|-|
| Close  | Light Melee  | 1 | |
| Close  | Heavy Melee  | 2 | Heavy Melee weapons take both hands to use |
| Close  | Magic        | 1 | |
| Close  | Light Ranged | 1 | |
| Near   | Heavy Melee  | 1 | Heavy Melee weapons take both hands to use |
| Near   | Magic        | 1 | |
| Near   | Light Ranged | 1 | |
| Near   | Heavy Ranged | 2 | Heavy Ranged weapons take both hands to use |
| Far    | Magic        | 1 | |

# Combat

## Rounds

Combat is divided into Rounds.
Each Round is about 6 seconds.
Each PC and NPC takes their Turn during a Round.
Once all PCs and NPCs that can act have taken their Turn the Round ends and, if necessary, a new Round begins.

## Initiative

Initiative is determined by which side has the highest Quickness of the group member that has the lowest Quickness.
In case of a tie both groups act in unison with individual members with the highest Initiative going first.

> The party has Emesyn with Quickness 4, Taranis with Quickness 7, and Jim with Quickness 6.
> The party's Initiative is a 4 because Emesyn only has a Quickness of 4.
> The NPC mercenaries have a Quickness of 4 and their leader has a Quickness of 8.
> The enemy group's Initiative is a 4 because the mercenaries all have a Quickness of 4.
> Both groups go at the same time, with the leader going on 8, Taranis on 7, Jim on 6, and finally Emesyn and the mercenaries going simultaneously on 4. 

If one side is surprised, they lose initiative.

## Stance

Characters start each Turn by choosing their Stance.
A Stance determines how offensive or defensive the character wishes to be that Turn.

### Active

An Active stance allows the character to use 150% of their Aspect value for opposed active skill use and opposed combat purposes, but only 50% of their Aspect value for resistive and defensive purposes.

### Balanced

An Active stance that allows the character to use 100% of their Aspect value for all purposes.

### Passive

A Passive stance allows the character to use 150% of their Aspect value for resistive and defensive purposes as well as unopposed checks, but only 50% of their Aspect value for opposed active skill use and opposed combat purposes.

## Actions

Each character gains 2 Actions a Turn.
Each Action can be used to Attack, Move, or Test.

### Opposed

You may take an Opposed action against an opponent or obstacle.

### Move

You may move to Close, Near, or Far.

### Unopposed

You may take an Unopposed action against an obstacle or defenseless opponent.

## Opposed Challenges

Whomever has the highest total wins.
Apply all effects for winning.

Whomever has the lowest total loses.
Apply all effects for losing.

In the case of a tie, neither side wins.
Apply all effects for winning and losing.
