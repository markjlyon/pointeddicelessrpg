# Combat

## Rounds

Combat is divided into Rounds.
Each Round is about 6 seconds.
Each PC and NPC takes their Turn during a Round.
Once all PCs and NPCs that can act have taken their Turn the Round ends and, if necessary, a new Round begins.

## Initiative

Initiative is determined by which side has the highest Quickness of the group member that has the lowest Quickness.
In case of a tie both groups act in unison with individual members with the highest Initiative going first.

> The party has Emesyn with Quickness 4, Taranis with Quickness 7, and Jim with Quickness 6.
> The party's Initiative is a 4 because Emesyn only has a Quickness of 4.
> The NPC mercenaries have a Quickness of 4 and their leader has a Quickness of 8.
> The enemy group's Initiative is a 4 because the mercenaries all have a Quickness of 4.
> Both groups go at the same time, with the leader going on 8, Taranis on 7, Jim on 6, and finally Emesyn and the mercenaries going simultaneously on 4. 

If one side is surprised, they lose initiative.

## Opposed Challenges

Challenges compare the two opponents totals:

- If the difference is 25% or more, that opponent wins in 1 action.
> P1 has 10, P2 has 15, P2 automatically wins the turn against P1.
- If the difference is less than 25%, you must spend additional turns focusing on that opponent until a number of turns equal to the difference have passed, only then is the winner revealed.
